@article{Filatov2010,
abstract = {Solid state crystal structures are discussed and compared for all seven members of the indenocorannulene family that have been recently synthesized by iterative microwave-assisted intramolecular arylations and characterized by single crystal X-ray diffraction. These bowl-shaped polyaromatic hydrocarbons include monoindenocorannulene (C26H12), two isomers each of diindenocorannulene (C32H14) and triindenocorannulene (C38H16), tetraindenocorannulene (C44H18), and pentaindenocorannulene (C50H20), with all molecules mapping onto the geodesic framework of the C60-fullerene. This extended family of $\pi$-bowls represents a unique case of a stepwise build-up of size, curvature, and strain at the corannulene core. It allows the first evaluation of the effects of controlled extension of nonplanar $\pi$-aromatic surfaces on the solid state structures of the resulting crystalline solids. First, a face-to-face $\pi$?$\pi$ alignment of individual bowls to form 1D stacks is considered and compared for all the above indenocorannulenes having different numbers and different positioning of indeno-groups fused to the corannulene core. Second, the orientations of these 1D columns with respect to each other and their secondary interactions are analyzed. Interesting packing trends and crystal structure variations are found as the size and the curvature of the $\pi$-bowls increase. These large $\pi$-conjugated carbon-rich systems constitute promising new materials for applications in molecular electronics, with the key to unlocking their specific and unique properties lying in the solid state packing and intermolecular interactions of the individual $\pi$-bowls. A thorough analysis of the crystalline structures of the indenocorannulene family, augmented by DFT calculations, has allowed the first predictions of their bulk materials properties.},

The analysis presented here capitalizes on a rare opportunity provided by corannulene to account explicitly for molecular distortions from crystal packing forces.

The reliability and shortcomings of geometry calculations at other levels of theory are enumerated.},

abstract = {The clustering of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) molecules is investigated in the context of soot particle inception and growth using an isotropic potential developed from the benchmark PAHAP potential. This potential is used to estimate equilibrium constants of dimerisation for five representative PAH molecules based on a statistical mechanics model. Molecular dynamics simulations are also performed to study the clustering of homomolecular systems at a range of temperatures. The results from both sets of calculations demonstrate that at flame temperatures pyrene (C 16 H 10) dimerisation cannot be a key step in soot particle formation and that much larger molecules (e.g. circumcoronene, C 54 H 18) are required to form small clusters at flame temperatures. The importance of using accurate descriptions of the intermolecular interactions is demonstrated by comparing results to those calculated with a popular literature potential with an order of magnitude variation in the level of clustering observed. By using an accurate intermolecular potential we are able to show that physical binding of PAH molecules based on van der Waals interactions alone can only be a viable soot inception mechanism if concentrations of large PAH molecules are significantly higher than currently thought.},

abstract = {The trajectories of a single nitrogen molecule resulting from a series of collisions with coronene molecular clusters of varying size are determined numerically by means of classical molecular dynamics simulations at two system temperatures, corresponding to the clusters being in solid and liquid state. The observed bimodality of the residence time distributions that corresponds to a combination of specular and diffuse molecular scattering tends to disappear with increasing temperature due to the more rapid rearrangements of the coronene cluster constituent molecules in the liquid state. The mean residence time decreases with increasing system temperature and appears to be independent of the coronene cluster size within the cluster size-range considered here. The recorded trajectories of the nitrogen probe are relatively tortuous, on average one order of magnitude longer than the shortest path connecting the impact and desorption points. The vast majority of the sites visited during the nitrogen molecule residence period correspond to the atoms at the edge of coronene molecules, mainly hydrogens. The intermolecular cohesive forces between the molecules cause that the coronene clusters are impenetrable by the nitrogen probe at temperatures below their thermal dissociation point.},

According to our results, the main stabilizing contribution is dispersion, followed by electrostatics. Regarding the ability of DFT methods to reproduce the results obtained with the most expensive and rigorous methods, TPSS-D seems to be the best option overall, although its results slightly tend to underestimate the interaction energies and to overestimate the equilibrium distances. The other two tested DFT-D methods, B97-D2 and B3LYP-D, supply rather reasonable results as well. M06-2X, although it is a good option from a geometrical point of view, leads to too weak interactions, with differences with respect to the reference values amounting to about 4 kcal/mol (25{\%} of the total interaction energy).},

This work presents electronic structure calculations of the dipole moment for 18 different curved PAH molecules for various numbers of pentagons and the total number of aromatic rings. A significant dipole moment was found that depends strongly on the number of aromatic rings (4−6.5 D for ring count 10−20). The main cause for the dipole is shown to be the $\pi$-electron flexoelectric effect. An atom-centered partial charge representation of the charge distribution in these molecules is insufficient to correctly describe their electrostatic potential; distributed multipoles were required instead.},

abstract = {Electron-transfer processes that involve single and doubly charged cations of corannulene (C 20 H 10 ) and coronene (C 24 H 12 ) are examined by three different mass-spectrometric techniques. Photoionization studies give first-ionization energies of IE(C 20 H 10 ) = 7.83 ± 0.02 eV and IE(C 24 H 12 ) = 7.21 ± 0.02 eV. Photoionizations of the neutrals to the doubly charged cations occur at thresholds of 20.1 ± 0.2 eV and 18.5 ± 0.2 eV for corannulene and coronene, respectively. Energy-resolved charge-stripping mass spectrometry yields kinetic energy deficits of Q min (C 20 H + 10 = 13.8 ± 0.3 eV and Q min (C 24 H + 12 = 12.8 ± 0.3 eV for the transitions from the mono- to the corresponding dications in keV collisions. Reactivity studies of the C 20 H 2+ 10 and C 24 H 2+ 12 dications in a selected-ion flow-tube mass spectrometer are used to determine the onsets for the occurrence of single-electron transfer from several neutral reagents to the dications, affording two different monocationic products. With decreasing IEs of the neutral reagents, electron transfer to doubly charged corannulene is first observed with hexafluorobenzene (IE = 9.91 eV), while neutrals with lower IEs are required in the case of the coronene dication, e.g., NO 2 (IE = 9.75 eV). Density-functional theory is used to support the interpretation of the experimental data. The best estimates of the ionization energies evaluated are IE(C 20 H 10 ) = 7.83 ± 0.02 eV and IE(C 24 H 12 ) = 7.21 ± 0.02 eV for the neutral molecules, and IE(C 20 H + 10 ) = 12.3 ± 0.2 eV and IE(C 24 H + 12 ) = 11.3 ± 0.2 eV for the monocations.},

The electrostatic (Ees) and induction (Eind) energies were calculated with distributed multipoles and distributed polarizabilities model. Induction and electrostatic interactions are the major source of the attraction. The Eind values of the Li+/$\pi$ complexes are 2.5?2.8 times larger than the Ees. The Eind values of the Na+/$\pi$ complexes are 40?80{\%} larger than the Ees. The induction energy is approximately proportional to R-4. The thin structure of the benzene, which enables the cation to have the short contact with carbon atoms of benzene, is essential for the large Eind. More polarizable cyclohexane is not a better cation binder than benzene. The Eind value of the Li+/cyclohexane complex is considerably smaller than that of the Li+/benzene complex. The Li+/cyclohexane complex has larger intermolecular separation, and therefore has the smaller Eind. The small Eind and negligible Ees of the Li+/cyclohexane complex are the causes of the smaller binding energy of the Li+/cyclohexane complex. The tert-butylbenzene complexes have larger binding energies than the benzene complexes. The larger Eind in the tert-butylbenzene complexes are the cause of the larger binding energy.},

The interactions in the pyridinium and N-methylpyridinium complexes should be categorized into a cation/pi interaction, because the electrostatic and induction interactions greatly contribute to the attraction. On the other hand, the interaction in the pyridine complex is a pi/pi interaction. The dispersion interaction is mainly responsible for the attraction in the benzene-pyridine complex. Short-range interactions including charge-transfer interactions are not important for the attraction in the three complexes. The most stable pyridinium complex has a T-shaped structure, in which the N-H bond points toward the benzene, while the N-methylpyridinium complex prefers a slipped-parallel structure.

abstract = {Graphene, carbon nanotubes, and fullerenes are of great interest due to their unique properties and diverse applications in biology, molecular electronics, and materials science. Therefore, there is demand for methods that can accurately model the interface between carbon surfaces and their environment. In this letter we compare results for complexes of water, potassium ion, and chloride ion with graphene, carbon nanotube, and fullerene surfaces using a standard non-polarizable force field (OPLS-AA), a polarizable force field (OPLS-AAP), DFT, and ab initio theory. For interactions with water, OPLS-AA with the TIP3P or TIP4P water models describes the interactions with benzene (C(6)H(6)) and coronene (C(24)H(12)) well; however, for acenes larger than circumcoronene (C(54)H(18)) and especially for C(60), the interaction energies are somewhat too weak and polarization is needed. For ions interacting with carbon surfaces, inclusion of polarization is essential, and OPLS-AAP is found to perform well in comparison to the highest-level quantum mechanical methods. Overall, OPLS-AAP provides an accurate and computationally efficient force field for modeling condensed-phase systems featuring carbon surfaces.},

Average errors for absolute and relative free energies of hydration for the ions are ca. 1 kcal/mol. For the halides, this is the first self-consistent set of parameters that has been optimized for aqueous-phase performance. The good results for relative free energies of hydration are particularly auspicious for use of the new parameters in a wide variety of liquid- phase simulations where halide and alkali cations are systematically varied.

abstract = {Starting from our earlier model [J. Chem. Phys. 66, 1496 (1977)] a simple expression is derived for the radial dependent damping functions for the individual dispersion coefficients C2n for arbitrary even orders 2n. The damping functions are only a function of the Born–Mayer range parameter b and thus can be applied to all systems for which this is known or can be estimated. For H(1S)–H(1S) the results are in almost perfect agreement with the very accurate recent ab initio damping functions of Koide, Meath, and Allnatt. Comparisons with less accurate previous calculations for other systems also show a satisfactory agreement. By adding a Born–Mayer repulsive term [A exp(−bR)] to the damped dispersion potential, a simple universal expression is obtained for the well region of the atom–atom van der Waals potential with only five essential parameters A, b, C6, C8, and C10. The model has been tested for the following representative systems: H23$\Sigma$, He2, and Ar2 as well as NaK 3$\Sigma$ and LiHg, which include four chemically different types of van der Waals interactions for which either very precise theoretical or experimental data is available. For each system the ab initio dispersion coefficients together with the well‐known parameters ϵ and Rm were used to determine A and b from the model potential.

abstract = {Particle nucleation remains one of the most intriguing steps in the process of particle formation in flames. Although stacking/clustering of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) has been identified as a key step in the nucleation process, uncertainties remain about the size of the PAHs undergoing clustering, the organisation of the PAHs in the forming clusters and the factors affecting the relative amounts of order and disorder present in the texture organisation. A molecular dynamics approach is presented to study the influence of the molecular weight and structure of PAHs on the nucleation and coagulation processes and on the morphology of the formed clusters. Two different types of macromolecules have been analysed: pericondensed aromatic hydrocarbons (PCAHs) and aromatic aliphatic linked hydrocarbons (AALHs), known to be present in flame environments depending on flame temperature, equivalence ratio and fuel chemical structure. Clustering of six organic molecules has been analysed at two extreme temperatures, namely 500 K and 1500 K. The six molecules have been chosen on the basis of their molecular weight (pyrene and coronene) and molecular structure (single molecules, covalent-bonded dimers and covalent-bonded trimers). Nucleation of single pyrene molecules is negligible at low temperature and practically absent at high temperature. Conversely, nucleation of single coronene molecules involves 33{\%} of the initial molecules at low temperature. Molecules within the clusters are highly mobile at flame temperatures and just 5{\%} of the initial molecules are in clusters. The presence of covalent bonds among the aromatic sub-units improves clustering and growth, both for pyrene and coronene sub-units. Looking at the structure and the fractal dimensionality of the formed clusters, an enhancement of the disorder of the clusters is observed in the case of the AALHs (dimers and trimers) with an increased number of molecules not arranged in parallel planes. The same behaviour is found for the higher temperature.},

The latter energy was extrapolated to the interaction energy of two graphene sheets. The effects of interactions of multiple layers were also estimated leading to the exfoliation energy of graphite equal to 45.3 meV per carbon atom. The SAPT(DFT)-based decomposition into physical quantities of the interaction energies shows the dominant effect of the dispersion interactions with a weaker electrostatic contribution due to penetration effects. The extrapolated physical picture of the graphene-graphene interaction is very similar to that of smaller stacked polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.},

abstract = {The chemistry community now recognizes the cation-$\pi$ interaction as a major force for molecular recognition, joining the hydrophobic effect, the hydrogen bond, and the ion pair in determining macromolecular structure and drug-receptor interactions. This Account provides the author's perspective on the intellectual origins and fundamental nature of the cation-$\pi$ interaction. Early studies on cyclophanes established that water-soluble, cationic molecules would forego aqueous solvation to enter a hydrophobic cavity if that cavity was lined with $\pi$ systems. Important gas phase studies established the fundamental nature of the cation-$\pi$ interaction. The strength of the cation-$\pi$ interaction (Li(+) binds to benzene with 38 kcal/mol of binding energy; NH4(+) with 19 kcal/mol) distinguishes it from the weaker polar-$\pi$ interactions observed in the benzene dimer or water-benzene complexes. In addition to the substantial intrinsic strength of the cation-$\pi$ interaction in gas phase studies, the cation-$\pi$ interaction remains energetically significant in aqueous media and under biological conditions. Many studies have shown that cation-$\pi$ interactions can enhance binding energies by 2-5 kcal/mol, making them competitive with hydrogen bonds and ion pairs in drug-receptor and protein-protein interactions. As with other noncovalent interactions involving aromatic systems, the cation-$\pi$ interaction includes a substantial electrostatic component. The six (four) C($\delta$-)-H($\delta$+) bond dipoles of a molecule like benzene (ethylene) combine to produce a region of negative electrostatic potential on the face of the $\pi$ system. Simple electrostatics facilitate a natural attraction of cations to the surface. The trend for (gas phase) binding energies is Li(+) {\textgreater} Na(+) {\textgreater} K(+) {\textgreater} Rb(+): as the ion gets larger the charge is dispersed over a larger sphere and binding interactions weaken, a classical electrostatic effect. On other hand, polarizability does not define these interactions. Cyclohexane is more polarizable than benzene but a decidedly poorer cation binder. Many studies have documented cation-$\pi$ interactions in protein structures, where lysine or arginine side chains interact with phenylalanine, tyrosine, or tryptophan. In addition, countless studies have established the importance of the cation-$\pi$ interaction in a range of biological processes. Our work has focused on molecular neurobiology, and we have shown that neurotransmitters generally use a cation-$\pi$ interaction to bind to their receptors. We have also shown that many drug-receptor interactions involve cation-$\pi$ interactions. A cation-$\pi$ interaction plays a critical role in the binding of nicotine to ACh receptors in the brain, an especially significant case. Other researchers have established important cation-$\pi$ interactions in the recognition of the "histone code," in terpene biosynthesis, in chemical catalysis, and in many other systems.},

In all cases, complexes with the cation in the convex side are more stable than its corresponding partner inside the bowl. When forming the complexes with the alkaline cations, these bowls exhibit great stability but several descriptors that usually work in planar conjugate molecules (like the magnitude of the charge transferred to the cation or the cation-ligand distance) do not properly describe the trends observed. The present study shows that with these curved $\pi$ systems inductive effects play a central role in the formation of complexes with alkaline cations. This conclusion contradicts the simplistic point of view on the dominant effect of the electrostatic term in the interaction between alkaline cations and bowls derived from fullerene.

abstract = {Soot nucleation bridges the transition from gaseous hydrocarbons to macromolecular building blocks (nanoparticles) that eventually turn into soot. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) have often been invoked as important compounds of this process but their role has not been clearly identified. In this paper we report on a detailed analysis of the physical interactions between PAH in the range 200-450 amu using Molecular Dynamics simulations. In particular, we identified a pool of nine aromatics and studied their clustering behaviors in systems composed of thousands of homo-molecular and hetero-molecular molecules to understand the influence of molecular mass, morphology and temperature on the nucleation process. At temperatures higher than 1000 K, small clusters of PAH (2-5 molecules) are detected but they are not stable enough to accommodate the further growth into larger particles. This result raises doubts on the ability of these molecules to become soot nuclei. Molecular morphology is another important parameter for the nucleation process. Aromatics with attached aliphatic chains show considerably faster nucleation rates than the corresponding polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons of similar mass without any chain. The collision efficiency is not increased by the aliphatic chain attachments, which may indicate that a faster nucleation process for these systems is due to the ability of these molecules to accommodate the collision energy into additional internal vibrational modes of the aliphatic chains. The results of this study provide information on the clustering behavior of PAH and can lead to the development of a more complex model to describe the physical nucleation of PAH that includes molecular masses, morphologies and temperature as main parameters to describe the transition from gas-phase species to macromolecular structures. ?? 2010 Published by Elsevier Inc. on behalf of The Combustion Institute.

@article{Eaves2015,
abstract = {Given the upcoming EURO 6 regulations, which include limits on particle number density (and hence size) for soot emissions from land vehicles, soot models must be capable of accurately predicting soot particle sizes. Previous modeling work has demonstrated the importance of the relative strengths of nucleation and condensation in predicting soot primary particle size; however, fundamental models still rely on tunable constants for modeling both processes, which limits predictive capability. Recent investigations into nucleation and condensation processes suggest that both processes are not thermodynamically favored to occur from 5-ringed PAHs, yet 5-ringed PAHs have been experimentally observed in abundance within nascent soot particles. This contradiction leads to the understanding that nucleation and condensation from 5-ringed PAHs is plausible, although they are likely highly reversible processes. A fundamental reversible model for nucleation and condensation is developed through the use of statistical mechanics and the results from several recent works. The model is highly sensitive to both the binding energy and the vibration frequencies created during the nucleation and condensation processes, although reasonable values are obtained through an extensive literature review. A model for tracking the PAHs on the surface of soot particles is developed, which allows for the calculation of the reverse rate of nucleation and condensation. The inclusion of reversibility in the nucleation and condensation subroutines enables the model to accurately reproduce all relevant soot morphological parameters determined experimentally for the atmospheric pressure, laminar, ethylene-air Santoro flame. This is due to more accurate partitioning of PAH mass through the nucleation and condensation processes. The developed reversible model represents an advancement in fundamental soot formation modeling by replacing tunable constants with fundamental physics.},

In the present work, the research effort has been focused on improving knowledge of in-cylinder heat transfer and its impact on engine efficiency. In particular, soot radiation was studied since it can be considered a significant source of the efficiency losses in modern diesel engines. Considering previous studies, the portion of total chemical energy released during combustion lost due to radiation heat transfer varies widely from 0.5{\%} up to 10{\%}, depending on engine parameters and combustion process. Thus, the main objective of this work was to evaluate the amount of energy lost to soot radiation relative to the input fuel chemical energy during the combustion event under different operating conditions in a completely controlled environment provided by an optical engine. Under these simplified conditions, two-color method was applied by using high speed imaging pyrometer with cameras (two dimensional results) and optoelectronic pyrometer (zero dimensional results). Once a detailed comparison between both diagnostics was performed, optoelectronic pyrometer was used to characterize radiant energy losses in a fully instrumented 4-cylinder direct-injection light-duty diesel engine. In particular swirl ratio, EGR and combustion phasing effects on radiation heat transfer were evaluated.},

@article{Johansson2016,
abstract = {We present a combined experimental and probabilistic simulation study of soot-precursor. The experiments were conducted using aerosol mass spectrometry coupled with tunable vacuum ultraviolet radiation from the Advanced Light Source at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Mass spectra and photoionization efficiency (PIE) curves of soot precursor species were measured at different heights in a premixed flat flame and in a counter-flow diffusion flame fueled by ethylene and oxygen. The PIE curves at the pyrene mass from these flames were compared with reference PIE scans recorded for pyrene. The results demonstrate that other C16H10 isomers than pyrene are major components among species condensed onto incipient soot in this study, which is in agreement with the simulations. Species with mass 202 u only have a high prevalence in incipient soot particles drawn from the premixed flame, but hydrocarbon species with sizes in the range 200-400 u are important to incipient-soot formation in both flames. The simulations predict that some species form through combination reactions involving relatively large radicals and bypass traditional molecular-growth pathways through addition of small hydrocarbon species. The experimental results support this prediction; they demonstrate that these species have higher relative abundances in particles formed close to the fuel outlet than smaller, lighter molecular species and indicate that these species are important to early formation of incipient-soot precursors. The results also imply that a leading role in incipient-soot precursor formation is played by species with lower thermal stability than the even-carbon numbered, unsubstituted polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons known as "stabilomers".},

abstract = {The vaporization enthalpies ($\Delta$1gHm (298.15 K)) of endo- and exo-tetrahydrodicyclopentadiene (THDCPD) have been measured by correlation gas chromatography. Values of (50.2 ± 2.3) kJ{\textperiodcentered}mol-1 and (49.1 ± 2.3) kJ{\textperiodcentered}mol-1 have been obtained for the endo and exo isomers, respectively. The sublimation enthalpy of the endo isomer ($\Delta$crgHm(298.15 K) = (51.2 ± 2.4) kJ{\textperiodcentered}mol-1) has been obtained by combining fusion and vaporization enthalpies adjusted as necessary to T = 298.15 K. Low-temperature d.s.c. studies of both isomers reveal solid-to-solid phase transitions. The endo isomer, which is a plastic crystal at room temperature, exhibits a solid-to-solid phase transition at T = 214 K ($\Delta$cr(2)cr(1)Hm(214 K) = (10.7 ± 0.13) kJ{\textperiodcentered}mol-1) and a melting temperature of 356.8 K ($\Delta$cr(1)1Hm(356.8 K) = (3.48 ± 0.2) kJ{\textperiodcentered}mol-1) with some evidence of polymorphism. The exo isomer exhibits a solid phase transition at T = 162.1 K ($\Delta$cr(2)cr(1)Hm(162.1 K) = (3.18 ± 0.11) kJ{\textperiodcentered}mol-1) and a melting temperature of 183.2 K ($\Delta$cr(1)1Hm(183.2 K) = (1.20 ± 0.04) kJ{\textperiodcentered}mol-1). Enthalpies of vaporization and sublimation are combined with the respective enthalpies of formation previously reported to yield the following gas-phase values: for endo THDCPD, $\Delta$fHm0 = -(61.9 ± 3.2) kJ{\textperiodcentered}mol-1; and for exo-THDCPD, $\Delta$fHm0 = -(73.7 ± 2.7) kJ{\textperiodcentered}mol-1. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Observational infrared emission spectra have been plausibly interpreted in support of this hypothesis, but the small (or zero) dipole moments of planar, unsubstituted PAHs preclude their definitive radio astronomical identification. Polar PAHs, such as corannulene, thus represent important targets for radio astronomy because they offer the possibilities of confirming the existence of PAHs in space and revealing new insight into the chemistry of the interstellar medium. Toward this objective, the high-resolution rotational spectrum of corannulene has been obtained by Fourier transform microwave spectroscopy, and the dipole moment (2.07 D) of this exceptionally polar PAH has been measured by exploiting the Stark effect.},

abstract = {Soot affects climate change and human health. Its structure is influenced by fuel and combustion conditions. Image analysis of high-resolution transmission electron microscopy lattice fringes indicates curvature is common and impacts reactivity. Here an improved curvature quantification determined the distributions of segment frequency, segment lengths, angles between segments, frequency of inflection points, relative inflection point locations, and overall angle changes for each fringe for three soots and a carbon black. Curvature was present in 28–49{\%} of the fringes. Low curvature ({\textless}30°) account for the largest portion (61–76{\%}). The most common inflection angles were 10–20°. Geometry optimized (ab initio) atomistic models containing centrally located pentagon rings or Stone-Thrower-Wales defects had angle changes 19–77° depending on viewing angle and molecule. The majority of curved fringes (71–78{\%}) had a singular inflection point. Fringes were primarily within the range 6–15.0{\AA} length 4–100° cumulative angle. Tortuosity data demonstrated this commonly used parameter was limited for the evaluation of undulating curvature. Linking these data to structural defects will enhance linking reactivity to structure, capturing and improving structural features in atomistic representations. Changes in segment angles {\textless}45° however are not likely to be associated with centrally placed isolated pentagon rings.},

abstract = {This work overviews the coordination properties of fullerene fragments or buckybowls, a new class of open geodesic polyaromatic hydrocarbons that map onto the surface of fullerenes but lack their full closure. In contrast to fullerenes, the bowl-shaped polyarenes have both the convex and concave unsaturated carbon surfaces open and available for coordination, which makes them unique and interesting ??-ligands for metal binding reactions. Variable synthetic methods based on solution and solid-state reactions have been developed to access transition metal complexes of buckybowls and to reveal their coordination properties. These studies have been mainly focused on the smallest fragments of the C60-fullerene, corannulene (C20H10) and sumanene (C21H12). In order to utilize directional metal-??-arene interactions effectively and to differentiate ??-bonding sites of buckybowls, we have introduced a micro-scale gas-phase deposition method. We have proven this technique to be very effective for the preparation of metal complexes of buckybowls in a single crystalline form. Plus, it allowed us to expand the coordination studies to larger bowls, including dibenzo[a,g]corannulene (C28H14), monoindenocorannulene (C26H12), and the C3-symmetric hemifullerene (C30H12). Specifically, several dimetal core complexes of varied electrophilicity have been used in the gas-phase coordination reactions to identify the preferential binding sites and to test the coordination limits of ??-bowls in a solvent-free environment. The coordination preferences of several buckybowls having different surface area and bowl depth, as well as different curvature and strain are compared and discussed here based on the results of X-ray diffraction and DFT calculation studies. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

The important effect of temperature in each type of experiment is examined. The relative tendency of various fuels to soot when consumed in pre-mixed and diffusion flames has been determined by the qualitative measurements of critical sooting equivalence ratios and smoke heights at various temperatures and quantitatively confirmed by measurements of chemical species, soot number density and volume fraction. Fuel structure has a significant effect on the sooting tendency of diffusion flames, but little influence in premixed flames. Irrespective of the fuel in diffusion flames soot inception occurs around 1400 K and is dependent somewhat on H atom diffusion. Particle burnout ceases at about 1300 K and is responsible for the smoke height. Incipient particle formation determines the volume fraction of soot and is controlled by the rate of formation of the first aromatic species containing one to two rings. The particle growth process is found to be the same regardless of flame type. A generalized chemical mechanism of soot formation irrespective of flame type or process is presented. The various routes in this mechanism support the relative sooting tendency of fuels found in both flame and shock tube experiments. The effect of oxygen added to various fuel in diffusion controlled experiments is analyzed. {\textcopyright} 1997 Combustion Institute.},

             The previously developed DFT-SAPT approach, which combines

             with a density-functional theory DFT representation of
             the monomers, has been implemented by using density fitting of
             two-electron objects. This approach, termed
             DF-DFT-SAPT, scales with the fifth power of the molecular size
             and with the third power upon increase of the basis set size
             for a given dimer, thus drastically reducing the cost of the
             conventional DFT-SAPT method. The accuracy of the density fitting
             approximation has been tested for the ethyne dimer. It has been
             found that the errors in the interaction energies due to density
             fitting are below 10 3 kcal/mol with suitable auxiliary basis
             sets and thus one or two orders of magnitude smaller than the
             errors due to the use of a limited atomic orbital basis set. An
             investigation of three prominent structures of the benzene dimer,
             namely, the T shaped, parallel displaced, and sandwich geometries,

             that DF-DFT-SAPT outperforms second-order Moller-Plesset theory

and T-shaped configurations. The interaction energies at the minima
of stacked configurations of the benzene, naphthalene, anthracene and
pyrene dimers increase with the number of rings, but¿in contrast to
literature findings¿the rate of increase is somewhat irregular. In
particular, the anthracene molecules interact slightly stronger than
indicated by the number of rings and the pyrene molecules interact
significantly weaker (although the latter do interact stronger than
the former). These trends can be partly rationalized by the physical
decomposition of the interaction energies given by SAPT. We find the
stacked structures to be significantly more stable than the T-shaped
ones, with the relative stability of the former structures increasing
as the size of the system increases. This observation extends to the
benzene dimer where the two structures are nearly isoenergetic and a
tilted T-shaped structure actually becomes the global minimum. For the
naphthalene dimer, the greater stability of the stacked configuration
than of the T-shaped one is in disagreement with recent experiments
observing only the latter structure. For the anthracene dimer, theory
is in agreement with experiments.  },

The distributed multipole analysis procedure, for describing a molecular

unpredictably when the basis set is improved, even though the resulting
electrostatic potential changes very little. A revised procedure is
proposed, which uses grid-based quadrature for partitioning the
contributions to the charge density from diffuse basis functions. The
resulting procedure is very stable, and the calculated multipole moments
converge rapidly to stable values as the size of the basis is increased.},

        Accurate atom-atom dispersion coefficients are needed if we are to be
        able to successfully model the intermolecular interactions between
        organic molecules. To go beyond the usual C6 description we have to
        resort to accurate ab initio methods, and we use the
        Williams-Stone-Misquitta methodology to obtain anisotropic distributed
        dispersion coefficients to C12 on each atomic site. Comparisons with
        SAPT(DFT) energies show that the resulting descriptions are very
        accurate, even for molecular contacts, where the asymptotic series is
        thought to be invalid. The complexity of our most accurate models
        limits their applicability, so we explore simplifications that are
        more suitable for use in calculations of the condensed phase, in
        particular, we describe a means of calculating optimized isotropic C6
        models that can be readily used in conventional programs. },

@article{Williams1999,
abstract = {A new intermolecular force field of the (exp-6-1) type was derived from observed hydrocarbon crystal structures selected from a comprehensive set of 134 molecules with 5-16 carbon atoms, and eight observed heats of sublimation. Carbon atoms with four bonds, C(4), and those with three bonds, C(3), were assigned separate parameters. Wavefunctions were calculated for each molecule and the molecular electric potential was modelled with net atomic charges. Methylene bisector or ring center site charges were added as necessary to fit the molecular electric potential. Each crystal structure was relaxed by energy minimization; for 101 of the structures the force field predicted changes in unit cell edge lengths less than 3{\%}. The remaining 33 crystal structures, while otherwise meeting data quality criteria, showed predicted unit cell edge length changes greater than 3{\%} and were not included in the training set.},

  abstract = { Creating accurate, analytic atom¿atom potentials for
  small organic molecules from first principles can be a time-consuming
  and computationally intensive task, particularly if we also require
  them to include explicit polarization terms, which are essential in
  many systems. We describe how the CamCASP suite of programs can be
  used to generate such potentials using some of the most accurate
  electronic structure methods currently applicable. We derive the
  long-range terms from monomer properties and determine the short-range
  anisotropy parameters by a novel and robust method based on the
  iterated stockholder atom approach. Using these techniques, we develop
  distributed multipole models for the electrostatic, polarization,
  and dispersion interactions in the pyridine dimer and develop a
  series of many-body potentials for the pyridine system. Even the
  simplest of these potentials exhibits root mean square errors of only
  about 0.6 kJ mol¿1 for the low-energy pyridine dimers, significantly
  surpassing the best empirical potentials. Our best model is shown to
  support eight stable minima, four of which have not been reported
  before in the literature. Further, the functional form can be made
  systematically more elaborate so as to improve the accuracy without a
  significant increase in the human-time spent in their generation. We
  investigate the effects of anisotropy, rank of multipoles, and choice
  of polarizability and dispersion models. },
