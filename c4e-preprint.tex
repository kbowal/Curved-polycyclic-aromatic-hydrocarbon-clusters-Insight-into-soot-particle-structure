\begin{abstract}
The structure and properties of nanoparticles containing curved polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (cPAHs) are investigated using molecular modelling. Due to the inclusion of one or more five-membered rings within their hexagonal lattice, these polar fullerene-like molecules possess unique steric and electronic properties that make them good candidates for many applications including microporous materials for gas storage, organic electronic devices such as imaging probes and batteries, sensors, and micelles for targeted nanomedicine. Development of these applications requires an understanding of the self-assembly and dynamic nanostructure of cPAH nanoparticles, which has not yet been well explored. This work uses replica exchange molecular dynamics to determine the energy-dependent nanostructure of cPAH particles. The interactions between cPAH molecules are described using the new curPAHIP potential. A range of cPAH sizes and ratios are investigated, along with systems containing planar PAHs and ions, to explore the homogeneous and heterogeneous particle internal arrangements and properties. Homogeneous cPAH particles are found to be tightly packed and less stacked than their planar PAH counterparts. The constituent cPAH size plays a role in the molecular arrangement, with large 15 ring cPAHs (C42H14) displaying long-range order absent in nanoparticles containing small 7 ring cPAHs (C20H10). Heterogeneous particles containing cPAHs of different sizes display a core-shell structure in which the larger molecules make up the core and the smaller molecules comprise the shell, as seen with planar PAH nanoparticles. This trend is not strongly influenced by the molecule ratio. In addition, the presence of planar PAHs and ions within cPAH nanoparticles promotes distinct arrangements dominated by weak dispersive interactions and strong electrostatic interactions, respectively. These systems may be indicative of nanoclusters generated in processes such as combustion. These results provide new information on structures and properties of nanoparticles containing cPAHs, including density, molecular structure, surface composition, and melting point estimation. This provides valuable understanding of the self-assembly and growth of nanoparticles with great potential in many applications.



Understanding the formation and properties of soot particles is critical for the accurate description of turbulent reacting flows within combustion. Due to the small time and length scale of these particle dynamics, a complete description of soot particle properties has remained a challenge. Curved polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (cPAHs) have been identified as key constituents of soot particles and we have recently shown that their interactions with ions may contribute significantly to particle formation (Bowal, K, et al. "Ion-induced soot nucleation using a new potential for curved aromatics'', Combustion Science and Technology (2018, accepted)). The structural properties of cPAH clusters are unknown and further molecular modelling studies are required to provide insight into the clustering behaviour of cPAHs - their size-dependent arrangements, interactions with planar PAHs, and assembly around ions.

Curved carbon materials arise from the inclusion of non-hexagonal rings within a hexagonal lattice and exhibit unique steric and electronic properties. These fullerene-like molecules are candidates for many applications including gas storage, batteries, imaging probes, and targeted nanomedicine. Development of these technologies requires an understanding of the self-assembly and dynamic nanostructure of particles containing curved carbons, which has not yet been well explored.
This work uses advanced molecular dynamics simulations to explore the nucleation behaviour and properties of nanoparticles containing curved carbons. Intermolecular interactions were described using the recently developed curPAHIP potential able to capture the enhanced interactions of curved aromatics. Large timescales and temperature ranges were sampled to provide insight into the dynamic behaviour of curved aromatics in homogeneous systems as well as those containing planar molecules and cations. It was seen that heterogeneity has a significant effect on particle nucleation, with electrostatic interactions between polar components dominating. The size and ratio of constituent fullerene-like molecules have significant effects on the internal structure and surface properties of nanoparticles. These results provide information on the self-assembly of curved carbons, as well as insight into the energetic and structural properties of the resulting nanoparticles, useful for an accurate understanding of the dynamic nature of these systems.
