\label{sec:Introduction}

%% Curved carbons are everywhere...
Curved carbons are found in many materials including porous carbons (ref), glassy carbons (ref), and soot particles (ref).
% curvature (ie defects) integrated easily in (production) processes
% Mesophase pitch is used to produce many materials, including synthetic graphite.
% Mesophase: formation of columns of curved molecules is important!  
% Alignment of liquid crystals gives it its electronic properties 

For example, high resolution transmission electron microscopy analysis of coals and cokes show that a significant proportion (28-49\%) of the constituent molecules are curved \cite{wang2017improved,zhong2018structural}. %(with a structure corresponding to centrally located pentagonal rings in aromatic structures)  % also curvature: 10.1021/acs.energyfuels.5b02907


%% Curvature is caused by... (incl experimental refs)
This curvature is caused by the presence of non-hexagonal rings, such as pentagons, within a hexagonal lattice. The resulting molecules have steric and electronic properties not present in defect-free carbon materials containing hexagonal structures only. In particular, curved carbon-based molecules possess a dipole moment due to the flexoelectric effect \cite{Martin2017}. This allows curved molecules to interact in long-range electronic interactions, such as dipole-dipole interactions, not present in systems containing planar carbon molecules.
% even important in small proportions since seem to interrupt formation of mesophase...
The presence of curved aromatic molecules influences material structure and properties, for example contributing to a low degree of molecular ordering %and poor stacking (only ~20\% stacked)
\cite{zhong2018structural}, increased porosity \cite{zhang2020molecular}, % providing enhanced adsorption important for applications such as carbon sequestration
and XXX. For example, the integration of curvature in molecules is crucial in determining whether a combusted wood-based material produces graphitic or non-graphitised carbon \cite{abrahamson2018carbon}. This suggests that curved aromatic molecules prevent graphitisation by disrupting formation of the mesophase. %diminishes anisotropy which provides reduced connectivity in lower (1 and 2) dimensions.


%% Arrangement of atoms determines everything...
The arrangement of atoms in a carbon material determines its structure, properties, and function. Nanostructure is crucial to understand the existing and potential behaviour of carbon materials. For example, it provides the understanding of (how to optimise) a structure's stability/longevity, environmental interactions, and ability to store other molecules, which are all vital for gas storage, drug delivery, or sequestration applications.  Similar information about the detailed structure of the material is required for other applications such as batteries, adsorbents, %involving thermal protection, conductivity.
sensors, and novel nanocarbon materials.
In addition to providing the understanding required to optimise the nanostructures for these applications, this provides insight into the natural processes and environments that generate nanoparticles containing polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, such as combustion-produced pollutants (ref) and interstellar medium (ref).

% - carbon blacks instead of soot (materials focus)
% example, carbon blacks used as cubits for spin systems (find paper)

Carbon materials have been fabricated for use as adsorbents, carriers, catalyst supports, electrodes, and other advanced applications (refs).  The performance of these materials can be directly improved/tuned for these applications by adjusting their physical properties - in particular their nanostructures.  It is therefore crucial to develop a detailed understanding of the molecular interactions involved to enhance the prediction and design of desired carbon nanostructures.

Flame-formed carbon nanoparticles show quantum dot behaviour (10.1073/pnas.1900205116) (not yet known how PAH structure and size, cluster structure, etc influence these properties).

%% Previous work looking at cPAH interactions:	Homogeneous dimers
Previous work on the structure and properties of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) has focused on those that are flat/planar (fPAHs) \cite{Grancic2016,chen2014size} %(add non-CoMo refs!)
, with less attention given to curved PAHs (cPAHs). However, electronic structure calculations show that there is significant energy in interactions between nested concave-to-convex homogeneous cPAH dimers, showing that curvature does not prevent dimers from forming pi-pi stacked assemblies similar to planar systems (10.1002/qua.21794, 10.1002/jcc.25084). As with fPAHs, cPAH dimer interactions are dominated by $\pi$-$\pi$ interactions compared to CH-$\pi$ interactions. However cPAHs in the concave-convex dimer configuration show different behaviour than fPAH dimers and cPAHs in convex-convex configuration, with the eclipsed dimer (in which the aromatic planes are aligned) showing a higher stability than the staggered dimer (in which the aromatic planes are shifted relative to each other) (10.1016/j.cplett.2011.07.030, 10.1002/jcc.25084).
Dispersion provides the dominant energy contribution, although electrostatics are also significant especially in contrast to fPAH dimers (10.1002/jcc.25084, 10.1016/j.cplett.2011.07.030). 
%Pi-pi > pi-CH interactions, eclipsed > staggered.

Different degrees of curvature can result in increased or decreased cPAH dimer strengths, due to geometry and (less so) electrostatic effects. Curvature is able to increase interaction strength by decreasing C-C distances for increased dispersion interactions (10.1021/jp305700k). 
However, very curved PAHs have lower interaction strengths similar to fPAHs due to increased steric hinderance (10.1016/j.proci.2018.05.046, 10.1002/qua.21794). High curvature also increases exchange-repulsion and can destabilise the dimer (10.1021/jp305700k, 10.1002/qua.21794).


%% Previous work looking at cPAH interactions:	Bulk systems
Analysis of the crystal structure of cPAHs shows a molecule size dependent behaviour. Corannulene (\ce{C20H10}) is the smallest cPAH, containing one central pentagon with five surrounding hexagonal rings (shown in Figure~\ref{fig:clustersnapshots}). Corannulene has no long-range stacked order in crystal analysis (10.1107/S0567740876012430, 10.1021/jo050233e, 10.1021/acs.analchem.8b05260, 10.1016/j.carbon.2015.06.041, 10.1021/ar950197d). 
%CH-pi interactions dominate. Shallow bowl, rapid bowl inversion.
CH-$\pi$ interactions, in which the posivitely charged rim of one molecule is almost perpendicular to the negative region and the bottom of the other molecule in a T-shaped configuration, exists in the corannulene crystal (10.1515/znb-2010-0403). This is supported by evaluation of the electrostatic potential of corannulene.

In contrast, cPAHs with increased size, curvature, rigidity, and/or heteroatoms form columnar stacks (10.1021/ar950197d, 10.1039/C39940002571, 10.1021/ja0123148, 10.1021/ja970845j, 10.1021/acs.jpcc.6b10895, 10.1016/j.carbon.2015.06.041, 10.1002/anie.200460855, 10.1021/om040131z, 10.1021/cg100898g, 10.1021/ja0518169, 10.1039/A905860E, 10.1515/znb-2010-0403, 10.1021/cr050554q). These systems show larger $\pi$-$\pi$ overlap and staggered stacked interactions to produce extended $\pi$ networks enhanced by CH-$\pi$ interactions.


%% Limitations of existing work
To date, detailed studies of cPAHs have primarily included static DFT calculations or crystal structure experiments, as described above, neither of which provide information about intermolecular dynamics and particle nanostructure.


%% Previous work looking at cPAH interactions:	Heterogeneous systems (dimers, etc)
% need to do a better job at splitting ideas: increased electrostatics and interactions with ions vs different structure and bowl complementarity
Computational studies of fPAHs show that, unlike cPAHs, heterogeneous dimers are significantly weaker than their homogeneous counterparts (ref). This heterogeneity was shown to decrease the stability of a nanoparticle containing different molecule sizes and lead to a distinct partitioning in which the larger molecules formed the cluster core and the smaller molecules resided in the outer shell \cite{bowal2018partitioning}. Dynamic interactions of cPAHs or fPAHs with cations also highlighted the ability of cPAHs to engage in electrostatic interactions that stabilise a cPAH cluster, while fPAHs cannot \cite{bowal2019ion}. These results suggests that the fundamental interaction differences between fPAHs and cPAHs may cause different clustering and packing behaviours. Preliminary work suggests that the nanostructure of homogeneous cPAH clusters is significantly different from similar-sized fPAH clusters \cite{bowal2019ion}, and perhaps different molecule sizes will show increased packing and stability due to bowl complementarity.
% This may be more representative of the experimentally observed structure of nascent soot particles.

- Include paper on functionalising corannulene to get stacks

Molecular models studying bulk systems found that curved PAHs demonstrate a higher adsorption capacity compared to systems containing both cPAHs and fPAHs and especially homogeneous fPAH systems, likely due to their higher porosity \cite{zhang2020molecular}.

%So expect homogeneous corannulene nanocluster to be disordered, homo 2pent15ring cluster to have stacks. Expect mixed cPAH cluster to be dominated by 2pent15rings but enhanced corannulene stacking and more stable than comparable mixed fPAH cluster.
% cPAH interactions with different sized molecules (no heteroatoms) (refs????). Increased stability compared to heterogeneous fPAH systems because of shape fitting and enhanced electrostatics and CH-pi interactions (?).
%Homodimers are weaker than heterodimers because they don't take advantage of bowl complementarity (10.1002/jcc.25084).
%Thus we hypothesise that heterogeneous cPAH clusters may be more stable than their heterogeneous fPAH counterparts since different sizes of cPAHs may provide stable packing arrangements.

%% Previous work looking at heterogeneous fPAHs…
%Previous work examined heterogeneous PAH clusters using replica exchange molecular dynamics \cite{bowal2018partitioning}...
% Explain how this work is extending previous work done on fPAHs (internal structure/partitioning, surface properties) - or should this essentially go in the methods section?

%% purpose of this work... 
The structural properties of cPAH clusters are unknown and further molecular modelling studies are required to provide insight into the clustering behaviour of cPAHs - their size-dependent arrangements in both homogeneous and heterogeneous systems, interactions with planar PAHs, and assembly around ions. Understanding non-covalent interactions with and between curved carbon nanostructures has importance in many systems and great potential for numerous applications.
% Development requires understanding of self-assembly and dynamic nanostructure of curved aromatics

The purpose of this work is to explore properties %(molecular arrangements, melting points, densities, surface properties, etc) 
of clusters containing curved PAHs, with the aim of answering the following questions: Are cPAH clusters more stable than fPAH clusters? Do cPAHs partition within clusters the same way fPAHs do? What is the internal nanostructure and surface composition of cPAH particles?  
%Predict long-range dipole-dipole interactions increase stability.
In this work, we are motivated to understand the influence of cPAHs in soot particle structure and stability, but these results have general relevance to nanoparticles containing cPAHs regardless of source or application.
%Hypothesis: cPAH clusters are more representative of the experimentally observed structure of nascent soot particles, heterogeneous cPAH clusters are significant since they are stable than their fPAH counterparts.
This is important for better understanding of soot particle formation and growth, and has implications for other carbon nanomaterials such as batteries, imaging probes, gas storage, optoelectronics, and targeted nanomedicine.
We will address these questions in this work by studying nanoparticle systems containing cPAHs, first in homogeneous clusters containing one molecule type only, then extending this to heterogeneous clusters to understand the interactions and effect of cPAH size and ratio. Finally, exploratory work on systems containing cation(s) and fPAHs is presented.

% "Properties of a matter are intrinsically dependent on the internal arrangement of molecules in the solid state. Therefore, knowledge of three-dimensional structure of the matter is a prerequisite for structure–property correlations and design of functional materials. Over the past century, X-ray crystallography has evolved as a method of choice for accurate determination of molecular structure at atomic resolution. The structural information obtained from crystallographic analysis paved the way for rapid development in electronic devices, mineralogy, geosciences, materials science, pharmaceuticals, etc."

% This paper is answering: What is the energy/structure of cPAH particles? How does this differ from fPAH particles? What is the influence of molecule size, proportion, and presence of ions or fPAHs?

\section{Methods}
\subsection{Systems} %% systems studied
To thoroughly evaluate the self-assembly of nanoparticles containing cPAHs, %influence of particle size, molecule size, molecule ratio, and ion interactions, 
16 different clusters are evaluated. First, homogeneous clusters containing 25, 50, 100, and 200 corannulene molecules and clusters containing 25, 50, and 100 \ce{C42H14} molecules are studied to provide information across molecule and cluster sizes.
Second, a series of binary clusters each containing 40 molecules of different sizes and proportions allows evaluation of heterogeneity effects. Heterogeneous clusters containing corannulene and \ce{C42H14} molecules in proportions of 40:0, 30:10, 20:20, 10:30, and 0:40 are studied. In addition, a heterogeneous cluster containing 50 corannulene and 50 \ce{C42H14} molecules addresses heterogeneous cluster size effects.
Third, clusters containing 20 corannulene molecules and 20 coronene molecules provide insight into the interactions between cPAHs and fPAHs.
Finally, clusters containing 40 corannulene of \ce{C42H14} molecules with one or two potassium cations allow investigation into the self-assembly of ion-containing clusters.
Snapshot images of each cluster considered in this work are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:clustersnapshots}. We should note that in this work, the terms (nano)particle and cluster are effectively synonymous: a nanoparticle is a cluster of molecules.

The notation $\text{X}_{\text{y}}$ is used to describe the clusters studied, where X values refer to the molecule types and y gives the number of each type of molecule. The molecule species considered in this work are: corannulene (indicated as A), \ce{C42H14} (B), coronene (C), and potassium cation (K). For example, $\text{A}_{\text{50}}\text{B}_{\text{50}}$ indicates a cluster containing 100 molecules, made up of 50 corannulene and 50 \ce{C42H14} molecules.


%%%%% Computational details %%%%%
\subsection{Density functional theory}
Density functional theory (DFT) calculations are used to determine the structure of cPAH monomers and configurations and energies of cPAH dimers, to assess the atomic and intermolecular descriptions employed in this work. The B97-D functional \cite{grimme2006semiempirical}, a hybrid functional with an empirical dispersion correction, is used in this work. Geometry optimisations are carried at the B97-D/6-311G(d,p) level of theory with frequency calculations to ensure suitable minima are found, and subsequent single point calculations use B97-D/cc-pVTZ, with basis set superposition error corrections.  These functional and basis sets were selected since they provide good agreement (within 4\%) with benchmark CCSD(T) \cite{janowski2011convex} and SAPT(DFT) \cite{Cabaleiro-Lago2018} calculations of small cPAH molecules. %A dimers. %and have been used in previous studies looking at cPAHs (Preprint 207)

\subsection{Cluster simulations}
Equilibrium cluster configurations are produced using a multi-step molecular dynamics simulation process. Clusters are initialised in a mixed configuration, with molecules randomly placed within a large spherical volume using the PACKMOL software \cite{Martinez2009PACKMOL}. Excess energy is removed by an energy minimisation step using the steepest descent algorithm, followed by the low-memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno method \cite{L-BFGS}.

Replica Exchange Molecular Dynamics (REMD) simulations are used to rapidly produce equilibrated cluster systems. Modelled after Monte Carlo parallel tempering \cite{Hukushima1996}, REMD is an advanced form of molecular dynamics that involves evaluating simultaneous isothermal systems, called replicas, across a temperature range \cite{Sugita1999}. At regular intervals throughout the simulation, neighbouring replicas are able to exchange spatial information based on a Boltzmann-weighted temperature dependent probability. This method allows efficient sampling of the system potential energy since low energy replicas are able to explore new configurations generated by higher energy replicas. 
% REMD simulations use a large number of interacting parallel simulations to rapidly determine stable structures across a large range of temperatures.
% able to rapidly determine low energy configurations by using higher energy parallel systems to explore new arrangements. % REMD was developed to enhance sampling of a complex potential energy surface, based on the fact that the rate at which barrier-crossing events occur is increased with an increase in temperature. 
% As a result, after an exchange, each low energy configuration exchanged into a higher energy replica has a better opportunity to overcome energy barriers and move into a new lower energy region of phase space, while each swapped high energy configuration provides a low energy replica with a fresh configuration to sample. 

In this work, REMD simulations are conducted for 3 ns. A large temperature range is selected to include solid-like and liquid-like particle morphologies. For clusters containing A molecules, B molecules, A and B molecules, and A and C molecules this corresponds to temperature ranges of 200 - 800 K, 400 - 1600 K, 200 - 1600 K, 200 - 800 K. This requires between 27 and 84 REMD replicas to maintain an acceptable replica exchange acceptance. Further information detailing the replica temperature selection and an assessment of effectiveness is given in the Supplementary Information Section \ref{secSI:REMDtemps}. As described in detail in similar work \cite{bowal2018partitioning}, a flat-bottomed spherical position potential is applied within the REMD simulations to address complete evaporation of small molecules from the cluster at high temperatures. Individual 1 ns simulations using classical molecular dynamics (MD) are then conducted at each desired temperature from the final REMD configurations. No position potential is implemented for these post-REMD MD simulations.

In the REMD and MD simulations the NVT ensemble, where a constant number of atoms, system volume, and temperature are maintained, is sampled using chain of $10$ Nos\'{e}-Hoover thermostats for temperature control. A velocity Verlet integrator \cite{Verlet_1967} is used to advance the configuration in 1 fs time steps and all simulations are conducted \textit{in vacuo} without periodic boundary conditions.  Intramolecular forces are determined using the OPLS-AA force field \cite{Kaminski2001opls} for molecular bonds, angles, dihedral and improper dihedral angles. The curPAHIP intermolecular potential \cite{bowal2019ion}, parameterised for cPAHs and discussed in more detail later, is used to describe interactions between cPAHs and intermolecular cut-offs are set to $3.0$ nm. All minimisation, REMD, and MD simulations are conducted using GROMACS 5.1.4 \cite{Abraham2015}. Purpose-made scripts are used to the process the output and VMD \cite{Humphrey1996} provides visualisations.

\subsection{curPAHIP potential} 
The isoPAHAP potential is an all-atom isotropic intermolecular description developed for planar/flat PAHs \cite{totton2010first}. It shows good agreement with high accuracy quantum calculations and has been used in dynamic and stochastic simulations of fPAH systems \cite{Totton2012quantitative,bowal2019sphere,Grancic2016,Pascazio2017}. This potential uses fixed atom-centred charges, which are suitable for fPAHs where electrostatic interactions arise principally from the terminal groups. It is not able to capture local dipole moments located at strained internal carbon sites within curved PAHs. Therefore, we previously developed a new atomic potential for cPAHs, called the curPAHIP potential \cite{bowal2019ion}. The curPAHIP potential models the increased polarity of cPAHs using a modified molecule description with off-site point charges located above the pentagonal carbon atoms, and through optimised potential parameters parameterised to SAPT(DFT) energies. Further details on the isoPAHAP and curPAHIP potential forms and parameters are found in the Supplementary Information Section~\ref{sec:SIpotentials}.

Following the parameterisation method developed and used to describe A molecules in \citet{bowal2019ion}, the B molecule is minimised and mass-less atoms are added at a distance of 0.052 nm above each of the pentagonal carbon atoms. This results in a dipole moment of 5.2784 D (within <1 \% of dipole calculated using DFT). The atomic coordinates and charges of the minimised B monomer (as well as the A molecule) are provided in the Supplementary Information Section \ref{sec:SImoleculedesc}.


%%%%% Analyses %%%%%
\subsection{Structural analyses}
% Structural analysis - Molecular arrangement analysis (radial distances, coordination numbers, stacking angle, etc).
A number of different metrics, including intermolecular spacing, coordination number, alignment angle, and radial distance, are used to evaluate system structural properties. All metrics are averaged over the  final 500 ps of the post-REMD simulation (\textit{i}.\textit{e}. 3500-4000 ps of total simulation time) using a timestep of 1 ps. 
%The final 500 ps of the post-REMD MD simulations are equilibrated and show <5\% drift in energy so this was selected as the production period.
Many calculations require the identification of near neighbours for each molecule within the system. For this, molecule centres of mass and the cut-off radius $R$ are used. Molecules are considered neighbouring if their centres of mass are within the cut-off radius for at least half of 500 ps production period. Unless otherwise stated, values of $R$ are selected to allow $>85\%$ of molecules to have at least one identified neighbour, considering increments of 0.1 nm. This results in cut-off radii of $R_{\text{A}} = 0.7$ nm and $R_{\text{B}} = 0.5$ nm for A and B molecules, respectively. 
% These cut-off radius values are used for both homogeneous and heterogeneous clusters 
%Although it may seem counter-intuitive that the smaller cPAH uses the larger cut-off distance, this is due to the different interaction types of the two molecules which will be discussed later.

%Intermolecular spacings are calculated between each molecule and its neighbours within $R$ and averaged over all equilibrated timesteps. The reported values are averaged over molecule type interactions in the system, including: all, B-B, A-A, and B-A.

% alignment angles
Molecular alignment angles are calculated to provide information on the relative configurations of neighbouring molecules within the clusters studied. An alignment angle is defined as the angle between normal vectors to the central rings (for A molecules this is the pentagonal ring and for B molecules this is the central hexagonal ring) of the neighbouring cPAHs considered.  Figure~\ref{fig:alignmentangle_schematic} provides a schematic of the alignment angle between two neighbouring A molecules.
%

\caption{Schematic illustrating the calculation of the alignment angle between two neighbouring A molecules. The central pentagonal rings are highlighted in red and the alignment angle ($\varphi$) is $30^{\circ}$. \textbf{Add this to alignment angles histogram figure?}}
\label{fig:alignmentangle_schematic}
\end{figure}
%

% coordination numbers
A quantitative measure of the degree of stacking order in the molecular structures is provided through the use of coordination numbers, calculated as the number of near neighbours averaged over each molecule type. To consider only $pi$-$pi$ stacking interactions within this metric, values of $R$ are selected to include sandwich-type stacked interactions between molecules but exclude molecules more than one layer away. Equilibrium dimer distances provide the minimum $R$ values for each molecule type as $R_{\text{A}} = 0.4$ nm and $R_{\text{B}} = 0.5$ nm. The sensitivity of these cut-off values on calculated cluster properties is discussed in the Supplementary Information Section~XXXX. The mathematical description of the coordination number is provided in the Supplementary Information Section~\ref{secSI:raddist_CN_eqns}.

% radial distances
Molecular radial distances are defined as the average distance between a molecule type and the cluster centre and provide insight into the spatial partitioning of molecule types within a cluster, particularly useful for understanding the self-assembly of heterogeneous systems. Further information on the calculation of radial distances and coordination numbers is provided in the Supplementary Information Section~\ref{secSI:raddist_CN_eqns}.

%These metrics were assessed and represent the A crystal structure well (see Supplementary Information Section~\ref{secSI:corannulenecrystal} for more details).


\section{Results}

\subsection{Intermolecular description of cPAHs} 
%%% The curPAHIP potential developed from corannulene energies can be used also to capture interactions between large cPAHs and mixed cPAHs %%%

The binding energies of cPAH dimers calculated by DFT calculations are compared to the curPAHIP intermolecular potential to assess the suitability of the latter in describing systems containing cPAHs.  This is shown for four dimer types in Figure~\ref{fig:potentialDFTcurves}.  The energy of the isoPAHAP potential is also included to highlight the behaviour of a potential that does not consider molecule curvature.
The curPAHIP potential agrees very well with the DFT and SAPT(DFT) results for the A dimer, Figure~\ref{fig:potentialDFTcurves}(a). This is expected since these \textit{ab initio} values were used in the parameterisation of the curPAHIP potential \cite{bowal2019ion}. 
Figure~\ref{fig:potentialDFTcurves}(b) shows that the curPAHIP potential can be extended to cPAH molecules larger than A, since there is good agreement with DFT energies for the larger B molecule (within 5\% of the dispersion-corrected DFT). In contrast, the isoPAHAP gives a minimum energy value that is 31\% smaller than the DFT B97D calculations.
Energies of heterogeneous dimers, containing one A molecule and one B molecule, are also well captured by the curPAHIP potential, as seen in Figure~\ref{fig:potentialDFTcurves}(c) and (d).  Of note, the nested dimer with the smaller A molecule on the concave side of the larger B molecule (Figure~\ref{fig:potentialDFTcurves}(c)) shows a T-shaped type configuration. In this system the curPAHIP potential provides a slightly smaller %need to quantify? 
angle between the two molecules in the minimum energy configuration than the DFT calculation, suggesting that CH-$\pi$ interactions are weaker and $\pi$-$\pi$ overlap is favoured using the intermolecular potential.  This difference does not seem to cause a significant difference in larger systems, however, as discussed further in the alignment angle analysis. % discuss how the dimer angle is seen in the stacks (20 degrees)
In all cases, the isoPAHAP potential significantly underestimates the binding energy and overestimates the equilibrium dimer distance since it does not include the enhanced electrostatics and dispersion due to the flexoelectric effect.
% Overall some slight differences compared to DFT results show repulsive component of curPAHIP is shifted to smaller distances (means that there might be stronger attractions at small dimer separation distances) and minimum is slightly lower energy (provides conservative case if any different (less likely to bond))
% The difference between the DFT and curPAHIP energies can be partly explained by the fact that the MD minimised monomers (used in curPAHIP assessment) are more curved than the DFT monomers. So perhaps the energies are not as low for the curPAHIP potential since the dimers are not able to reach the same small distance values without steric hindrance and repulsion coming into effect.
% but it is the form of the repulsive forcefield and overall energy that are the important part (Laura’s paper) - address repulsive form not great in Fig 2 (c)

\subsection{How do cPAHs self-assemble into a mesophase?}

% Cluster snapshots, CNs, angles show significant stacking of 2pent15ring molecules but not much for corannulene

%\subsubsection{Cluster diameters and densities}
%%% Cluster snapshots and macro properties (diameter, density) provided for reference %%%

Homogeneous clusters containing A or B molecules are studied to evaluate the self-assembled structures of these cPAHs. Cluster diameters and densities, given in Table~\ref{table:maintable}, show that the clusters are tightly packed. For example, the homogeneous A cluster densities are between 1.45 and 1.50 kg/$\text{m}^{3}$, higher than that of the A crystal structure at 1.36 kg/$\text{m}^{3}$ \cite{CORANN11unitcell}. In comparison to clusters containing fPAHs (refs)... % add density values of similar fPAH cluster(s)
Cluster densities decrease slightly with increasing cluster size. %is this expected? check Dongping's...
%diameter results are as expected - the more molecules, and the larger the proportion of larger molecules, the higher the cluster diameter.

Upon initial observation of the cluster snapshots in Figure~\ref{fig:clustersnapshots}, it is clear that these clusters self-assemble into different structural arrangements.  This will be explored further using a number of quantitative metrics.
%
% Include skeletal snapshots etc?

%

\subsubsection{Intermolecular spacing and stacking} % CNs or spacing first?

%\subsubsection{Intermolecular spacing}
%%% Intermolecular spacing suggests close interactions between large molecules compared to small molecules, no cluster size dependence %%%

The homogeneous cluster results show that intermolecular spacing is controlled by the molecular composition of the cluster rather than its overall size.  Across all cluster sizes, A molecule spacings are around 0.60 nm, and B molecule spacings are around 0.45 nm.  This is counterintuitive since the B molecule is more curved and therefore would seem to require a larger intermolecular spacing between molecules due to the sterics.  However, both of these values are higher than the interlayer spacing of graphite (0.33 nm (ref)). For reference, the intermolecular spacings for dimers using electronic structure calculations, using the same notation as in Figure~\ref{fig:potentialDFTcurves}, are (a) 0.36 nm, (b) 0.42 nm, (c), 0.44 nm, and (d) 0.46 nm. The average intermolecular spacing within a single layer of the A crystal structure characterised by X-ray crystallography is 0.57 nm. This suggests that the cluster structure of A is more similar to its crystal packing than the $\pi$-$\pi$ stacking arrangement dominant in clusters of fPAH clusters.

The intermolecular spacing of B does not change easily with the cut-off distance, indicating that the B molecules have distinct near neighbours, for example in a highly stacked configuration. In contrast, the A spacings are strongly correlated to the cut-off distance selected, suggesting that the molecules are not arranged in structured stacked layers. Intermolecular spacing values are reported for a number of cut-off distances in the Supplementary Information.

%\subsubsection{Coordination number}
%%% 2pent15ring molecules are stacked, corannulene molecules aren't %%%

The spacing values for the two molecule sizes suggests that the molecule types configure in different arrangements. 

Coordination number values provide information on the extent of stacking interactions, which can help explain the intermolecular spacing results and elucidate internal cluster structure. The A molecule clusters showed an average CN value of XXX +/- XX.XX, while the B molecule clusters possess CN values of XXXX +/- XX.XX.  This shows that, as seen in the cluster snapshots, B molecules arrange in stacks with near neighbours while A molecules do not have near neighbours within stacking distance.
% add results from unit cell or other literature?
% need to add CN values to table to show more homogeneous cases?  Or add to SI?
% include? "We find that the nearest neighbour coordination shells contain approximately XX molecules."

Coordination number analysis will be explored in further sections.

%Further applications: Understanding the stacking behaviour of curved PAHs is relevant to materials studies / supramolecular chemistry / crystalline organic materials because of their unique optical and conduction properties; and can also lead to using these molecules as building blocks for engineering organic crystals with desired properties.  Synthesis of curved PAH hybrids has shown that the $\pi-\pi$ interactions of these curved species can result in tight stacking in 1D columns (10.1021/acs.cgd.7b01258).

\subsubsection{Alignment angles}
%%% Molecule sizes have different molecular angles %%% 

Figure~\ref{fig:alignmentangles_homo} presents histograms of the molecular alignment angles, illustrating the relative configurations of neighbouring molecules within homogeneous clusters studied.
% homo clusters - compare to crystal structure/sandwich dimer, increasing cluster size
It is immediately clear that the two molecule sizes behave differently. The B clusters (top row of Figure~\ref{fig:alignmentangles_homo}) show a single significant peak at XXX (around 20) degrees.  This suggests that nearly all of the molecules are interacting in a tilted stacked formation. In contrast, the coronene clusters (bottom row in Figure~\ref{fig:alignmentangles_homo}) show a dominant peak at around 45 degrees, with smaller peaks at around 130 and 170 degrees. This shows that there is less short-range order in the A clusters. Both sets of homogeneous clusters present alignment angles similar to those seen in the crystal structure (A) or minimised dimer (B), which are shown as dashed lines, suggesting that these nanoclusters possess some crystal-like structure.  Although the molecule sizes show different alignment angle distributions, both cluster types show the same behaviour across all cluster sizes considered. Additional cluster size plots can be seen in Figures \ref{fig:alignmentangles_hetero}, \ref{figSI:alignmentangles_cutoffs}, and \ref{figSI:alignmentangles_100}.

% multidimensional analysis shows that the local orientational order of the corannulene molecules are more complex than those of 2pent15ring.  At smaller separation/cut-off distance (< XX nm), the favoured nearest neighbour geometry is XXX (like 45deg angled? vs stacked) while at larger distances (> XX nm) it is XXX (like 90deg??).

Same core-shell partitioning as planar PAHs (big in centre, small in shell) but not as distinct - effect of molecule sizes. (radial distances, snapshots, coordination numbers, tilting angles, histograms)
Effect of ratio...
%Effect of temperature...

Cluster size does not influence structure but molecule size does (seen in CN and intermolecular spacing values).

Energies and CN values suggest that B clusters with some added (<50\%) A are the most sTable~and structured/stacked.

%The diameter and density values of the heterogeneous clusters containing two molecule types or addition of cations are consistent with simple mixing averages of the analogous homogeneous clusters. % This suggests that there are no large scale (ie changing macroscopic/external properties of cluster) influence of heterogeneity, however internal and molecule-specific effects are not captured here.

\subsubsection{Intermolecular spacing}
Table~\ref{table:mixedintermolecdists} breaks down the average results for heterogeneous clusters shown in Table~\ref{table:maintable} by considering the molecule-type contributions to the intermolecular spacing. %In heterogeneous systems, both individual molecule types maintain intermolecular spacing values similar to those found in their respective homogeneous clusters (in particular the 2pent15ring spacing does not vary). 
This shows that the homogeneous interactions between molecules of the same type show intermolecular spacings consistent with those in the homogeneous clusters (although decreases a bit with decreasing molecule proportion for A contributions). The mixed molecule interactions have similar spacings to those of the larger cPAH suggesting that the B molecule promotes stacking behaviour (pi-pi interactions) with A.  This is more pronounced with a higher proportion of B molecules compared to A molecules. 
However, neighbouring A molecules within the heterogeneous cluster do not tend to interact in a stacked order, although the spacing does decrease with an increased proportion of B molecules present (comparing two30ann10 to two10ann30). 

Comparing heterogeneous clusters: two50ann50 clusters show increased average spacing values indicating stronger contributions from A-A interactions compared to B-B interactions, even compared to the two20ann20 clusters. %two20ann20 has 22 pairs for TWO-TWO and only 4 for ANN-ANN (and 21 for TWO-ANN); two50ann50 has 24 pairs for TWO-TWO and 26 for ANN-ANN (and 23 for TWO-ANN).
The averages provide an indication of which molecule pairings are most prevalent - what type of stacking is most dominant. % include proportion / percentage values for each interaction type from number of pairs in each case?

\subsubsection{Coordination number}
%%% addition of 2pent15ring into corannulene clusters increases stacking %%%

To clearly examine the influence of compositional heterogeneity, coordination number values are compared across different clusters all containing 40 cPAH molecules, shown in Figure~\ref{fig:coordination_numbers}. (also because intermolecular spacing showed no significant difference with cluster size) % is this true for the CN values?
%
% fix dotted arrow so dots are more visible
\begin{figure}[!tbh]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{Figures/CN_bar_chart.eps}
\caption{Coordination number values across clusters containing 40 molecules.}
\label{fig:coordination_numbers}
\end{figure}
%
The B molecules within all clusters (except the ion-containing cluster) have coordination number values above 1, indicating that on average these molecules have more than one near neighbour in a stacked arrangement. In contrast, all A molecules have CN values significantly below 1, which shows that these molecules do not arrange in close stacks. The CN value trends match those seen in the energy values: lower energy clusters have higher CN values (more ordering) - except A, which has very low CN values. % move this if keep energy later!!! 
% For these 40 molecule clusters, the CN values are: ann < 10t30a(a) < 2020(a) < 30t10a(a) < 10t30a(t) < 20/20(t)=two < 30t10a(t).  
This shows that adding B molecules into A clusters increases the CN values for both molecule types (shown by the solid arrow).

Further analysis is conducted to determine which molecule types are present as near neighbours within heterogeneous systems.  We see that all A stacking interactions come from neighbouring B molecules.  The B molecule stacking interactions come predominantly from other B molecules, however a proportion of the interactions (shown as insets with horizontal lines in the B columns of Fig \ref{fig:coordination_numbers}) are with A molecules.  (Contribution of B stacking that came from interactions with A are: two30ann10 12\%, two20ann20 32\%, two10ann30 43\% - goes up with molecule type ratios).

\subsubsection{Alignment angles}
%%% Influenced by mixing and addition of cation(s) %%%

% mixed 50/50 - compare to homo systems, increasing cluster size
Next we examined the influence of molecule size mixing on the alignment angle distribution.  Figure~\ref{fig:alignmentangles_hetero} shows the following clusters: (a) homogeneous B, (b) homogeneous A, (c) heterogeneous containing 50\% of each molecule type. The individual molecule alignment angle distributions retain much of their features as in the homogeneous clusters with the majority of the B molecules around 20 degrees, and many of the A molecules around 45 degrees.  However, there is a distinct second peak around 45 degrees suggesting a break from the stacked structure in the homogeneous B clusters.  The A peaks in the heterogeneous cluster are also slightly shifted, with the peak at 45 degrees spread out towards 0 degrees and the peak around 120 degrees relatively insignificant.
The angle peaks align reasonably with those seen in the A crystal structure and B dimer (esp for the 100 molecule cluster).
%say something about corannulene molecules being sandwiched between larger ones and how this influences the angles...

\label{fig:alignmentangles_hetero}
\end{figure}
%

% mixed mixed - compare to homo and other mixed systems
Then we further investigated the influence of molecular ratio in the heterogeneous clusters by examining clusters of the same size containing Figure~\ref{fig:alignmentangles_hetero} (d) 75\% A or (e) 75\% B.  These clusters showed similar behaviour to the homogeneous and 50/50 heterogeneous clusters.  Interestingly, the second peak of B molecules at around 50 degrees is more pronounced in the system containing more B molecules, suggesting that this is found in the molecules that connect stacks of B molecules.  Also, in the cluster with fewer A molecules, they show increased interactions similar to B at 20 degrees.  This indicates that the A molecules are stacking in a similar fashion, which can be seen in the cluster snapshot (Figure~XX(x)) where the A molecules predominantly interact individually at the ends of B molecule stacks, fitting in similarly in the concave or convex surfaces.

\subsubsection{Radial distances}
%%% Core-shell type partitioning of molecule sizes - not as distinct as fPAHs and not dependent on cluster size or molecular ratio %%%

% need to include mention of homo radial distances here!

Radial distances are calculated to provide an indication of the molecule-type positioning within heterogeneous clusters. In all cases, the B molecules have smaller average radial distance values (shown as vertical dashed lines in Figure~\ref{fig:radialdists_atomic}, also reported in Table~\ref{table:maintable}) than the A molecules, showing that like heterogeneous fPAH clusters \cite{bowal2018partitioning} there is a core-shell partitioning of the molecule sizes. 
However, examining these values more closely by looking at the distributions of radial values, it is clear that this molecule size separation is less distinct for clusters containing cPAHs compared to similar fPAH clusters. This shows that there is significant mixing of the molecule types within the cPAH clusters, regardless of cluster size or molecular ratio.

Table~\ref{table:maintable} presents the average equilibrium radial distances for all clusters. For the homogeneous cases, the two molecule types show similar equilibrium radial distances according to the cluster diameter. However, in all clusters containing two molecule types the smaller A molecules possess larger radial distances than the larger B molecule. This is indicative of a core-shell structure in which the larger molecules reside in the cluster core, just as seen in the fPAH clusters \cite{bowal2018partitioning}.
The addition of a potassium cation(s) also results in decreases in the radial distances for both molecule types.

The average radial distance for homogeneous clusters is at 70-80\% of the total cluster radius. In contrast, in heterogeneous clusters the large molecules are between 60-80\% of the cluster radius and the small molecules are located within 80-90\% of the total cluster radius.  Clusters containing an ion have average molecular distance values between 60-70\% of the total cluster radius. %this comes from the tabulated values
Table~\ref{tableSI:radialdistances} lists the radial distance values for each cluster in its equilibrated configurations.

\subsubsection{cPAHs and fPAHs}
- show that cPAHs and fPAHs are immiscible 
- relevant to formation / nature of janus particles, for example ones that are polar on one side
- Also indicates that there must be bonds in soot particles because don’t see partitioning between curved and planar molecules experimentally!
- Soot structures seen experimentally do not form through self-assembly
- explain potential used and explain differences - show both cases in the SI

We conducted preliminary work assessing the properties of clusters containing cPAHs and fPAHs (corannulene and coronene). The results showed a distinct partitioning of the molecule types in a janus configuration. This can be clearly linked to stronger interactions between similar molecules compared to the mixed molecule interactions, which are hindered by sterics and do not experience any enhancement in electrostatic interactions (in a non-polarisable potential description).

Compare with experimental morphologies (do we see sections of curved/planar together?)
Relate these clusters and their properties to experimental structures (potential implications for synthesis, potential applications, etc).

\subsection{How do cPAHs self-assemble around ions?}

An additional exploration into the influence of heterogeneity with cations was conducted by considering clusters containing 40 molecules (A or B) and one or two potassium ions.  These systems can be directly compared to homogeneous systems of the same size.  Potassium ions were selected since the intermolecular interactions between this cation and cPAHs have already been parameterised with the curPAHIP potential \cite{bowal2019ion}. As seen in Table~XX, the presence of a cation

% decrease the number of headings here... combine densities, spacing, CNs, radial dists?
\subsubsection{Diameters and densities}
Inclusion of ion(s) within the clusters appear to increase the cluster diameter (and thus decrease the cluster density) slightly.

\subsubsection{Intermolecular spacing}
Intermolecular spacing values change with the addition of a cation(s). The B cluster experiences an increase in the spacing, while the A clusters show decreases in the spacing values in proportion to the number of cations present. This suggests that the cation has an effect on molecular arrangement, although in opposite ways depending on the constituent cPAH size.

\subsubsection{Coordination numbers}
The CN value results for ion-containing clusters complement the intermolecular spacing results. The B cluster CN value decreases with the addition of K+, suggesting a disruption of the highly stacked ordering and matches an increased intermolecular spacing. Conversely, the A clusters show some increased ordering with higher CN values and also decreased average spacing. This effect increases with the addition of a second cation, although the CN values are still significantly lower than those of the B clusters.

% perhaps include cluster snapshots with ribbons to show stacking more clearly?  As insets in bar chart?

\subsubsection{Radial distances}
Molecule radial distances of cPAHs decrease %(5-7\%)
with the addition of a K ion. This suggests that the molecular structure of the cluster changes, although interestingly the total cluster diameter and density do not change in the same way. Radial distance histograms show that introducing K+ into cPAH clusters produces an increase of cPAH molecules with very small radial distance values, suggesting that the ion(s) promotes an increased molecular ordering at/around the cluster centre. This is more marked for the B cluster case than A. 
The radial position of the ion(s) within the cluster does not correspond to a clear grouping/structure of cPAH molecules. % add or reference corresponding figure?
%note that this is visible in homo cPAH molecular radial distance histograms not show... see log notes.  Perhaps include these plots - can overlay histograms to show effect.  Can show ion position(s) with dashed lines in these plots.  And this could segue into talking about how the ion(s) influence the molecular structure around them...

Therefore, although the presence of an ion(s) causes more cPAH molecules to order around the cluster centre, this does effect seems to be very local and the total cluster shape/size is not changed.  (The ion(s) only influence a single shell of molecules and this has only an indirect effect on the rest of the molecules?)
The addition of a second K ion into the A cluster increases this effect - radial distance is decreased by 5\% with one K ion and a further 7\% with a second K ion. This suggests that the cation influence is additive, although further work needs to be done to assess when this trend reaches a saturation level (maximum effect) or in perhaps has cancelling or negative effects.


\subsubsection{Alignment angles}
% with cation
The alignment angle distribution broadens for the B system with the addition of a cation (Figure~\ref{fig:alignmentangles_hetero}(x)), with additional angles present at approximately 50 deg (confirm) and 135 deg.
The A clusters containing K+ are also different than the homogeneous case, with a broadening/splitting of the 45 deg peak, increase in the 120 deg (confirm) peak, and disappearance of high (around 170 deg) angles. This shows that the addition of a cation disrupts the stacked structure seen in all other clusters containing B molecules. This can also be seen in the cluster snapshots in Figure~XX(x)-(x), where the molecules are clustered with their electron-rich convex surfaces facing the cation but a lack of clear structure beyond this first layer of molecules surrounding the cation.
The addition of cation(s) show XXXXX alignment angle distribution that indicates the loss of regular local structure.
% It is interesting to note that the number of neighbouring molecules within the cut-off distance decreased for 2pent15ring molecule systems with the addition of a potassium cation. (this is seen in comparing cut-off distances behaviour) - is this still true after recalculating?


\subsubsection{Energies}
%%% ann clusters have lower mass-weighted energy than 2pent15ring, addition of some corannulene decreases energy (50/50 gives same as ann), fPAHs have higher energies %%%

The intermolecular energies as a function of cluster mass are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:energies}.  The energies are shown per atom in the system, in order to facilitate direct comparison between systems of different cluster and molecule sizes.
It is clearly seen that in all cases the energy decreases with cluster mass, for clusters containing curved or planar PAHs.  Homogeneous clusters containing planar PAHs, taken from refXXX, show relatively consistent energy trends across molecule sizes from pyrene to circumcoronene (all coloured the same here to allow for ease in reading), with heterogeneous clusters, taken from refXXX, generally at lower energy values.  Clusters containing the cPAH B show energies similar to those of heterogeneous fPAH clusters, while clusters containing the cPAH A have lower energies.
The effect of heterogeneity in cPAH clusters shows a distinct effect of molecular ratio: an increased proportion of B in the cluster decreases the energy. At 50\%/50\% molecule type partitioning, the heterogeneous cluster reflects that of a homogeneous A cluster (across cluster size). However, when the cluster contains only 25\% B, the cluster has significantly higher energy and inversely with 75\% B, the cluster's energy decreases significantly.  This suggests that the presence of B molecules increases cluster stability if above 50\% composition.
The presence of cation(s) in the cluster has opposite effects on clusters containing the two molecule types: B clusters with K+ show an increased energy, while clusters with A molecules containing K+ showed a decreased energy in proportion with the number of ions.  These differences are shown by black arrows in Figure~\ref{fig:energies}. This suggests that the ion influences molecular interactions and cluster structure in different ways depending on the molecule size.
%Finally, the energy of a cluster containing both curved and planar PAHs has an energy similar to that of homogeneous coronene clusters, showing that in these cases (not including some advanced interactions such as induced dipoles, 50/50\% split, very similar sizes so less cooperative perhaps) the mixing of molecule types does not enhance the interaction energy - it remains similar to that of the weaker component.  Further work to thoroughly develop/assess a fPAH-cPAH intermolecular potential and test the effect of molecular composition should be done to further explore the possible synergistic effects of clusters containing cPAHs and fPAHs.
The reason for and structural contribution/manifestation of these energy differences will be explored further in the subsequent sections.

\section{Conclusions}

These results provide a first detailed exploration of the nanostructure of clusters containing cPAHs and cation(s), and further work should examine the influence of ion type (cation vs anion), size, and number.

Future work:
Interactions between curved aromatic molecules containing heteroatoms, such as oxygen, show increased dimer interactions that provide further electrostatic stabilisation (10.1002/jcc.25084).  Future work should consider the presence of additional atoms...
