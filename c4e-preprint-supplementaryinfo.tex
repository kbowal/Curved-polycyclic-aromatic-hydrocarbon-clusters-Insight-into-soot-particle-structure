\subsection{Corannulene crystal structure}
In order to assess / benchmark the structural metrics used in this paper, they have been applied to the known crystal structure of a corannulene. %Further comparison is made with a 2pent15ring system and published large cPAH systems - Actually this should be included in the discussion sections of the paper I think.

X-ray analysis of corannulene was conducted in 1975, and it was determined that the compound crystallises in space group \textit{P}$2_{1}/c$ \cite{hanson1976crystal}.

A crystal structure containing 18 molecules, taken from The Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre \cite{CORANN11unitcell}, provides an independent verification of the analysis used in this work as well as a known experimental structure useful for comparison.  The crystal density and intermolecular distances are provided in Table \ref{tableSI:crystal}.  Figure XX shows the crystal structure and alignment angles.

\subsection{Cut-off distance sensitivities}
The selection of the cut-off distance, $R$, influences the calculated average intermolecular distances, coordination numbers, and alignment angles.

Due to the molecular arrangements of the homogeneous corannulene clusters (that is, sandwich-type stacking is not present), these results are the most sensitive to the selection of $R$.


Figure \ref{figSI:alignmentangles_cutoffs} shows the alignment angle distributions for all homogeneous clusters using four different cut-off distances.  The influence of the cut-off distance is minimal in the 2pent15ring clusters, which show a very high proportion of molecules with at least one near neighbour at all cut-off distances.  At the higher cut-off distances, a second peak corresponding to further molecule layers (ie not the nearest neighbours alone) appears.  The corannulene clusters show relatively similar angle distributions across the cut-off distances, although the percent of molecules with a near neighbour increases dramatically between $R=0.5$ nm and $R=0.6$ nm.

Dashed lines correspond to the corannulene crystal structure (for (a)-(e)) and the minimised 2pent15ring dimer (for (f)-(i)).

- Include figure of CN histograms with r=0.5 for corannulene and 2pent15ring

Note that for all systems, no neighbouring molecules are found using a cut-off distance of 0.4 nm or smaller (with the exception of ann\_40\_Kion\_1 and ann\_40\_Kion\_2 which have 15\% and 23\% of their molecules neighbouring at 0.4 nm).

- include table of intermolecular spacing for (just homo?) systems at different R values

Intuitively, for the corannulene molecule the cut-off distance selected correlates with the average intermolecular spacing between molecules (ie an increase in the cut-off distance produces an increase in the average intermolecular distance). %because increasing range of 'neighbours'
In contrast, the cut-off distance does not have a large impact on the average intermolecular spacing of homogeneous 2pent15ring molecules.  This highlights the highly stacked configuration of these molecules.

\subsection{Radial distances - homogeneous clusters}
For the homogeneous cases, the two molecule types show similar equilibrium radial distances according to the cluster diameter.
