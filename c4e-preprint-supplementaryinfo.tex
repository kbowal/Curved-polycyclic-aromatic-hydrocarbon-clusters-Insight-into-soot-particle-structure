\subsection{Simulation length equilibration check}
Energies and radial distances don't change significantly when comparing eqm result from 3ns simulation (final 1ns) or 1ns simulation (final 500ps)
Percent error of intermolecular energies are less than 0.2\%
Percent error of radial distances are less than 3.5\%


\subsection{Coordination number cut-off distances}
- Include figure of CN histograms with r=0.5 for corannulene and 2pent15ring
